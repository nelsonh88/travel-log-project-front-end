Process
- First made a wireframe https://imgur.com/ynl73GB
- Worked on authentication first and made sure all curl scripts worked then made it in HTML.
- Then worked on CRUD fields for trips and checked all curl scripts and then made in in HTML.
- Then styled authnetication and CRUD
- Anytime I got into an issue I used Google, Genral Assembly notes, and issue queue.

Unsolved Problems
- There are somethings that I want to do in the UI like make signup field more visible.
- I wanted to use a modal for the get trips field where the modal once clicked will give you all the info of the trip with the option to update trip and delete trip; instead of having it the way I have now where each CRUD action has its own dropdown menu.
- I would like enhance the user experinece in future updates.
